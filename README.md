muzei-unsplash
==============

Simple plugin for [Roman Nurik's Muzei Live Wallpaper](https://github.com/romannurik/muzei) with photo's from [Unsplash.com](http://unsplash.com). The plugin is not that complicated, and as it's my first Android app, its code could probably be improved significantly.

The real magic happens in /main/src/main/java/net/ralphbroenink/muzei/unsplash/. But you are better off looking at Roman's API documentation. Or just installing it from the Play Store:
